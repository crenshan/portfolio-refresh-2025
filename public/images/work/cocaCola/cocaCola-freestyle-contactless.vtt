00:00:05.289 --> 00:00:07.039
As the leader in fountain beverages,

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.329
Coca-Cola Freestyle has developed the latest in contact-free dispensing.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.050
All Coca-Cola beverage dispensers are safe to

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.200
use with the recommended care and cleaning,

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:17.760
but in the current climate,

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.090
people may be seeking touchless options as

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.090
they return to their favorite restaurants,

00:00:22.209 --> 00:00:23.129
grocery stores,

00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:24.329
and convenience stores.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.879
Coca-Cola Freestyle is introducing Mobile Pour,

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.000
a new way for your guests to pour their favorite drinks
using their smartphone.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.639
No app downloads or memberships required.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.639
Let's see how it works.

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.459
First,

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.090
the guest places their glass under the dispenser and

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.610
scans the QR code using their smartphone camera.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.099
Next,

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:46.610
they tap the pop-up banner,

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.860
opening a new browser window where they will

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.020
see all 32 beverage brands at their fingertips.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.090
Then they'll select their favorite brand,

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:55.250
like Coca-Cola,

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.180
and a flavor like Cherry Coke.

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:59.860
As they press and hold the pour button,

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.939
their drink is filled within seconds.

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:05.779
With Coca-Cola Freestyle's advanced capabilities,

00:01:05.919 --> 00:01:08.669
we're staying a step ahead on contact-free solutions

00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:12.599
and plan to start implementing them across all Freestyle
platforms this summer.
