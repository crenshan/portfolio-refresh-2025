I was responsible for the full-stack development for an art magazine, keeping the site in line with the same high level of design as the print version.

> Atlanta-based and globally-engaged, Art Papers serves the creative community and the culturally curious by expanding the dialogue around contemporary art and culture, exploring the ways they affect and reflect human experience. We do this in print, online, and through public programming.
